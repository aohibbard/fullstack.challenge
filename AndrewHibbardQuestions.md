## How long did you spend on this challenge?

Roughly 4 hours, with short breaks to respond to some things in my current job.

## In your opinion, what are features that Double could work on that would be helpful for assistants when managing agendas?

In working with this code, I think a DevOps style drag and drop menu to organize calendar events or to connect tasks to events could be a valuable way of thinking about larger flows and goals in day to day operations. 

## If you had more time, what would you add or change in the codebase?

I would have made better use of the useEffect hook to update the greeting on the page, likely employing a current/previous timestamp measure. If the hour changes and then the hour is evenly divisible by 3 or equal to 22, the time would update.

In terms of functionality, I would eventually have wanted to update the useMemo input array so that the page would be filtered based on the selection of departments or calendars. 

Additionally, I would have added a more attractive UI to the calendars other than a hexadecimal code for the name. In this vein, I think calendars should have names that are associated with colors rather than simply color values. The ability to sort calendars.
